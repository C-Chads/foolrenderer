# foolrenderer

![teaser image](teaser.gif)

**foolrenderer** is a rasterization based software renderer implemented from
scratch. Its main features include programmable rendering pipeline, physically
based materials, etc. Hope it helps someone who is learning computer graphics.

## Prerequisites

To build foolrenderer, you must first install the following tools:

### Windows

- Visual Studio 2019 (or more recent)
- CMake 3.5 (or more recent)

### macOS

- Xcode 12.3 (or more recent)
- CMake 3.5 (or more recent)

After installing Xcode you need to make sure the command line tools are set up
by running:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

## Build

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

## How to Learn Computer Graphics

Here are some very useful resources that you can also use as a learning roadmap:

### Getting Started

- [Grant Sanderson 2016, Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) -
Learning graphics requires knowing the basic concepts of linear algebra, and
this series of videos will help you enjoy mastering vectors, matrices and other
mathematical tools.
- [Dmitry V. Sokolov 2015, Tiny renderer or how OpenGL works: software rendering in 500 lines of code](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) -
An excellent introductory course in computer graphics. After taking this course
you will find that learning OpenGL has become a lot easier.
- [Lingqi Yan 2020, GAMES101: Introduction to Computer Graphics (Chinese course)](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html) -
Courses cover rasterization, geometry, ray tracing and animation. If you are a
Chinese speaker, this course can help you get started quickly.

### Advanced

- [Joey de Vries 2014, LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) -
When you master the basics of graphics, you can easily get started with graphics
APIs such as OpenGL. You can learn advanced features like Shadow Mapping, Gamma
Correction, Normal Mapping, HDR, SSAO and more in this course.
- [Lingqi Yan 2021, GAMES202: Real-Time High Quality Rendering (Chinese course)](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games202.html) -
The course introduces many real-time rendering techniques widely adopted by the
industry, such as shadows, environment mapping, global illumination, physically
based shading, real-time ray tracing, etc.
- [Grant Sanderson 2017, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) -
Watching this series of videos will at least help you understand the rendering
equation.

### Physically Based Rendering

- [Naty Hoffman 2013, Background: Physics and Math of Shading](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/hoffman/s2013_pbs_physics_math_notes.pdf)
- [Shree K. Nayar 2021, Radiometry and Reflectance](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zRqk16wsdpyQNZ6WFlGQtDICpzzQ925) -
The first 7 videos of this play list are helpful for understanding Radiometry
and BRDF.
- [Charles de Rousiers & SÃ©bastian Lagarde 2014, Moving Frostbite to PBR](https://www.ea.com/frostbite/news/moving-frostbite-to-pb) -
The EA DICE team detailed the PBR implementation of the Frostbite engine in this
course. Hope the *Battlefield 2042* update goes well.
