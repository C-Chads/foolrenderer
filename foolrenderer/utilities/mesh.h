/// The mesh is made of triangles, each triangle is defined by three vertex
/// indices. For example, a cube mesh has 12 triangles, then the indices array
/// length should be 36, with each value indicating which vertex to use. The
/// first three elements in the indices array are the indices of the vertices
/// that make up the triangle; the second three elements make up another
/// triangle, and so on.
///
/// For every vertex there can be a vertex position, texture coordinate
/// (texcoord), normal and tangent. These data are collectively called vertex
/// attributes. Vertex attributes other than position are optional.
//
/// All vertex attributes (if present) are stored in separate arrays of the same
/// size. For example, if a mesh has 100 vertices, and each vertex has position
/// and texcoord, then the mesh should have positions and texcoords arrays, each
/// being 100 in size. Data for i-th vertex is at index "i" in each array.
/// Pointers to other vertex attributes should point to null pointers.
///
/// If the mesh has no diffuse texture associated with it, diffuse_texture_path
/// points to a null pointer.
